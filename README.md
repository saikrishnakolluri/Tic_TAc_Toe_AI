#Histogram Equalization based Contrast Enhancement Technique

##Worked on research with the HOD of the IT Department.

##The developed method is applied on both grayscale and colour photos. The updated technique focuses on histogram correction and may be applied to any existing method for particular aims, resulting in a 20% noise reduction and a 25% improvement in picture brightness.
